    <!-- My Name Section -->
    <section id="my-name" class="section">
        <h2>If You're Interested in My Name</h2>
        <p>My name in Chinese is 王芷若, which reads as Wang, Zhiruo. It is usually hard for non-native speakers to pronounce, so you can also call me Zora (as ZR is similar to Zhi Ruo).</p>
        <p>I love my name, especially in Chinese characters, since it has a more beautiful meaning than in English alphabets. 芷 stands for 白芷 (Angelica dahurica) and 若 stands for 杜若 (Pollia japonica), which are two kinds of Chinese herbal medicine. Also, <a href="https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E8%8A%B7%E8%8B%A5/6244995">芷若</a> is a beautiful vanilla 🌿</p>
